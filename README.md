**Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis**

 
Introduction 
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst.
In this case study,  I used Cyclistic  company data, which is fictional company. I download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html .

**Ask**

Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


**Prepare**

1.	Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data. 
2.	There are 12 files, each contain one moth data.
3.	Unzip the files. 
4.	Loaded all csv into R studio and merged  all csv in to one csv.

**Analyse**

Now that data is stored appropriately into one CSV and has been prepared for analysis, start putting it to work..
Analysis using Python

1.	Imported data into Jupyter notebook using Python. 
2.	Clean data (Remove Null values, Remove Duplicated data, Changing data types of columns)
3.	Created some columns from the existing columns.
4.	Conduct descriptive analysis. 


**Power BI Dashboard**

Created Dashboard which shows visual representation of bike share cleaned data
